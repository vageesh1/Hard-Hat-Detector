# Hard-Hat-Detector
This is a hard hat detector in construction sites based on kaggle data <br>
I trained two models for the detection <br>
The annotations format is XMl format <br>
In both the models we need to convert our annotations <br>
In the yolov5 model it has a property of color changing of bounding box according to the color of helmet<br>
